Arduino-powered christmas tree.  I've used this sketch to animate
my 3D-printed christmas tree.
It's shy, so when someone gets closer, he starts blinking faster.


Electronic and hardware
-----------------------

Some LEDs, resistors and a proximity sensor.

The xmas\_tree.fzz file contains the Fritzing circuit diagram; for
the proximity sensor I've used a Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F; you
may use whatever you have, but you'll probably need to fix
some values in the code.

My christmas tree is a slightly customized version of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:186164 printed with a 3Drag.

Software
--------

Just copy the xmas\_tree directory into your ~/sketchbook directory.

Multimedia
----------

In the media directory, a short video of it in action, bringing
light and love into my office.
